##### Viewing entries:
You have two views: the Today and History views. In the today view, you can see which foods you've eaten today, and in the history view, you can see a history of your entries . If you've made a mistake in entering a food today, you can also delete it on the today page by clicking on it to remove it. Refer to the handy graphs to see if you're meeting your nutritional needs for your age and gender. Green means you've met your needs, but red means you still need some work!

## Technologies used: 
n端trient is a web application created using the **MERN** technology stack. The frontend was designed using **React.js** and **Bootstrap**. The backend of the app uses **Express.js**, a simple server framework for **Node.js**, the primary language used for handling serverside requests. User data is handled on the backend using the **Mongoose** Node module, which allows the backend to easily communicate with the **MongoDB** database. 

User data encryption and authentication are handled using **bcrypt.js** and **Passport.js**, respectively. **bcrypt.js** was used to encrypt user passwords, and **Passport.js** was used to authenticate user logins. 

Nutrient and food information was collected from the [Government of Canada's Candian Nutrient File API] (https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/90a31d6a-9131-4f31-a156-cd1f3b2717fe).
